- **Plans campaign coordination** across multiple platforms

#### **2. Content Generation → Task Management**
- **AI creates work tasks** in integrated project management tools (Trello, Asana, Notion)
- **Sets dependencies and timelines** for content creation workflow
- **Links tasks to calendar deadlines** automatically
- **Tracks content through approval stages**

#### **3. Social Media → Publishing Schedule**
- **Optimal timing suggestions** based on audience engagement patterns
